Fanged games is a one-person collective with the goal of creating raw games that bite.

**A raw game** is a text document with the rules to play it, not a nice book with uplifting images. It's not that nice books aren't good, but better leave that job to someone with the correct skillset.

**A biting game** is a game that compels players to keep the fiction in mind when playing. Another way to say it has teeth.
