## Moves

You get a Clique. It's usually half a dozen close friends who look up at you.

Choose 2 perks:
- They are a lot (like a dozen)
- They can defend themselves (they're armed or trained)
- They know people (who can sell them the cool drugs, or get them into the hot clubs)
- They share something (they are part of the same team or band)
- They are as family (they are ready to fight for each other)

Choose 2 downsides:
- They are few (like 2 or 3)
- They are dangerous (they have no problem with violence and crime)
- They are scorned (by other popular groups)
- They are different from you (in a significant way)
- They need something (from you, specifically)

Choose 2 moves

**The shield**: When you shield yourself with someone from your clique, roll +Cold. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.
- You aren't afraid
- They aren't afraid
- They aren't hurt

**Many bodies**: When you make a move on someone and roll a 7-9, you can choose that someone else from your clique, who is present, is turned on instead of you.

**And your enemies closer**: When someone betrays you, you gain a cold string over them.

**Puppeteer**: When you ask someone in your clique to do something for you, roll +Hot. On a 7-9, they choose whether to do it or be Uneasy. On a 10+ they choose whether to do it or be Hurt.

**Streaming**: When you probe the mind of someone in your clique, roll +Dark. On a 7-9, ask 1. On a 10+, ask 3:
- What do you think about ____?
- What's your greates fear?
- What's your greatest dream?
- What's your beef against ____?
- What's your stake in ____?

On a miss, they can ask you 3 questions. You must answer truthfully.

## Special move
When you introduce someone to the clique, they become part of the clique.

## Darkest self
While you are in your darkest self, you can use Puppeteer without rolling dice, as if you made a 10+. You escape your darkest self when someone in your clique stands up against you.

## Backstory
- You really want someone to be part of your clique: Give them a hot string
- You feel like someone is a threat to your status. Gain a cold string over them
