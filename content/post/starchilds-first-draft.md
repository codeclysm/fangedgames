> Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space,<br>
> Somewhere far away in space and time,<br>
> Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky,<br>
> We’re marooned on a small island, in an endless sea<br>
> Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape,<br>
> But tonight, on this small planet, on earth<br>
> We’re going to rock civilization…<br>
>   – Lyrics from “Prelude/Slam”, Pendulum

Starchilds is a scifi game about teenagers. The main idea came to me while looking at the stars and wondering whether I would gaze at them at the same way if I were living among them.

## Prep
- Choose the setting: space station, alien planet, bla bla
- Answer: what do we have that on earth is lacking?
- Answer:what do we lack here that they have on earth?
- Choose the playbooks

It's a pbta, so we have attributes!

- **Void** measure your perceived distance from others and the world
- **Mass** measure the impact you can have on others
- **Light** measure how much you are looked upon by others.

The basic moves are grouped by Mood. Every player will start with a Mood, and the Mood will probably change multiple times during the game.

The Moods are:

- **Blue**: Thoughtful, longing, sad
- **Hot**: Excited, ready for action
- **Sick**: Uneasy, on edge, worried.

If you currently have a Mood, you gain experience points when you use moves in that Mood group. Moreover, there are other benefits:

- *Blue*: you have access to the move Stargaze, which allows you to see the truth in people.
- *Hot*: if you’re doing things without caring about consequences, you get +1 at rolls
- *Sick*: Rolls against you can’t reach the full success.

Sometimes a move will tell you that you are **Hurt**. *Hurt* is not a Mood, so you can be *Blue* AND *Hurt* at the same time.

When you are *Hurt* you can’t reach the full success of your rolls. If you would become *Hurt* when you already are Hurt, you become *Broken*.

When you are *Broken* you can’t use moves at all. You can still play though.

To Heal from *Broken* to *Hurt*, or from *Hurt* to *Ok*, wait until time passes, or be healed by another character.

## Blue moves

### Stargaze
When you gaze at the stars voice your doubts and questions to the distant skies, choose another player and roll +Void.
On a 10+ they are Blue and they have to answer one of your questions
On a 7-9, they may lie about it.
On a miss, the MC will answer

### Razor tongue
When you say something to hurt someone, roll +Mass
On a 10+, they are Hurt
On a 7-9, they choose if they are Hurt or Sick. If they already are Sick, they can’t choose this option.

## Hot moves

### Make a move
When you make a move on someone, roll +Light
On a 10+ they choose:

- Act on their impulses and be Hot
- Refuse you and be Sick

On a 7-9 they can use Razor Tongue as if they rolled a 7-9

### Lash out
When you lash out at someone, roll +Mass
On a 10+ they choose 2:

- they are Hurt
- they give you something you asked for
- they are Hot

On a 7-9 they choose all 3.

## Sick moves (lol)

### Watch out
When you avoid problems, roll +Void
On a success, you are Blue
On a 10+ your problems will give you pause (but won’t disappear)

### Take care
When you take care of someone, roll +Light
On a 7-9 they choose if they are Healed or Blue.
On a 10+, if they chose to be Healed, you are Healed too
